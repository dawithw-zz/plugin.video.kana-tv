My first addon. 

It works, surprisingly. 

I might add some other elements to it in the future to make it look better and increase it's functionality.

To install: 

1. You need to download this in a zip file format. To do so, simply click the green Clone/Download button. Download it zip form. 

2. If your kodi isn't installed on the system you're using to download the zip file, copy it over to that system.

3. Go in Kodi > Settings > Addons > Install from zip > Select the zip file

4. Enjoy

Broken?

If the stream doesn't work, go to Kana TV's wesbite, and go to the Live Stream tab. Copy the link of the live-stream. Go to addons.py in addon folder (location vary depending on what OS you're using. Google it) and change the 'url' variable to the link you just copied. It's that easy
